    "## 🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation 🔄\n",

    "### 1. **Flask Backend API**\n",

    "* Organize using factory pattern.\n",
    "* Expose endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `/upload`: Accept file or URL\n",
    "  * `/understand`: Calls `understand_data(df_json)`\n",
    "  * `/clean`: Calls `clean_data`, with chosen strategy\n",
    "* Use `Flask-CORS` to allow React frontend origins ([Medium][1], [Streamlit][2], [Streamlit Docs][3]).\n",
    "* Keep pipeline logic modular in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **React Frontend**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Landing page: choose data source.\n",
    "* Forms and wizard-style UI: upload file, fill API URL, enter domain, null/duplicate strategies.\n",
    "* Show results and feedback from Flask calls (data previews, stats).\n",
    "* Embed interactive cleaning or exploration by embedding Streamlit UI:\n",
